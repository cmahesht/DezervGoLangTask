Problem Statement: ​ Build a system and add a feature to reset user passwords.  

Description:
    The flow:​

    Create a REST API that takes some form of user identifier (email/phone) and new password.
    Ensure the password meets our requirements.
    Update the user password in the database leveraging the API.
    If successful let the user be notified.
    If the password doesn’t meet our requirements, please let the user know what they can change.

Password requirements:
    Min: 1 lowercase and 1 uppercase alphabet
    Min: 1 number
    Min: 1 special character
    8-16 character length
    Shouldn’t be the same as username
    Shouldn’t be the same as last password

Technology: 
    The system should consist of a database (MongoDB), backend (Golang) and a REST API. If you want, you can build a frontend. (ReactJS, Redux).

Feel free to add Docker files or host it on GitHub. 

Timelines: 
    ​I would like to set the time limit to 3 days. But let us know if you need more time due to some other work.

Submission: 
    ​I would like to run the code locally. So anything from a Git repo to compressed files works for me. Be sure to include a README so I can get it up and running on my machine.

Best of luck!
